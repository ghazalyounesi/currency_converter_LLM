Currency Converter with LLM Agents

This project implements a currency conversion system powered by two collaborating LLM-based agents.
One agent is responsible for mathematical calculations, while the other manages user interaction and response generation.

Features

ðŸ”„ Dual-Agent Architecture

Calculation Agent â€“ Handles precise arithmetic operations, such as fetching exchange rates, performing multiplications/divisions, and returning accurate conversion results.

Conversation Agent â€“ Parses user input, delegates computational tasks to the calculation agent, and generates user-friendly, natural language responses.

ðŸ§  LLM-Powered Reasoning â€“ Leverages large language models to interpret requests and produce coherent answers.

ðŸ§© Modular Design â€“ Clear separation of responsibilities between the computational logic and conversational layer.

âœ… Extensible & Testable â€“ Easy to extend for new currencies, data sources, or additional features.

Tech Stack

Language: Python

LLM Integration: OpenAI/other compatible LLM APIs
